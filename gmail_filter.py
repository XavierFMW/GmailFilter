        strings and the permissions they allow.

    Notes:

        When ran for the first time, the user will be directed to a URL printed in the console. This URL will allow the user to officially connect the script

            labels           | Allows the program to create, read, and delete the label's of individual emails.
            send             | Allows the program to send messages only, does not allow the program to modify or read messages.
            readonly         | Allows the program to read all resources and their metadata, blocks all writing operations
            compose          | Allows the program to create, read, update and delete drafts, as well as sending messages and drafts.
            insert           | Allows the program to insert and import messages exclusively
            modify           | Allows the program to perform all reading/writing operations, with the exception of permanent and immediate deletion of threads and messages.
            metadata         | Allows the program to read resources metadata, except for the content of message bodies and attachments.
            settings.basic   | Allows the program to manange basic mail settings.
            settings.sharing | Allows the program to manage sensitive mail settings, such as forwarding rules and aliases. Restricted to admin use.
